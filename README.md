# Artworks Organizer

A simple Swift application to store photos of artworks. 

I take a lot of photos in galleries/ museums as inspiration for my future paintings but these reference photos always end up scattered in my photo library and I never look at them. Hopefully with this app I will be inspired to create more artworks!

Some key screenshots from the application:

Future ideas: 
- Another way to input artworks' metadata (scan?).
- Organize artworks by locations (museums/ galleries).
- Sort artworks by dominant colors.
