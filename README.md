# Artworks Organizer

A simple Swift application to store photos of artworks. 

I take a lot of photos in galleries/ museums as inspiration for my future paintings but these reference photos always end up scattered in my photo library and I never look at them. Hopefully with this app I will be inspired to create more artworks!

Gallery view (homefeed) of the app![gallery-view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47307668/150103112-327dd459-3e7c-41b7-9763-fabe6e842344.PNG | height=100px)

Future ideas: 
- Another way to input artworks' metadata.
- Organize artworks by locations (museums/ galleries).
- Sort artworks by dominant colors.
